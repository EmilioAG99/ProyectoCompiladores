# Abijava Compiler
During the development of this project, we used Python as our main programming language. Our intention was to create a compiler for a new language that included:
1. *Arrays*
2. *Variable declarations*
3. *Data types*
4. *Functions*
5. *Cycles*
6. *Conditionals*

To reach our goal, we used 2 pythons libraries that help us with the syntactic y lexical analysis, along with conditional statements to make sure that all cases from our language grammar were successfully understood.

## Additional Info
Within this repo you can find all the source code, and some test files to understand the syntax of this new programming language. The end results will be saved in a file text in the directory where the project is being run.

## Dependencies
Before running the project, you have to install the "ply" library in your development environment to assure that the programs run smoothly
